Explanation on Default Gateways -- https://www.experts-exchange.com/articles/1962/Briefly-explain-gateways-default-gateways-and-static-routes.html
Excerpt from the above link --
"In simple terms a gateway is formed when a computer such as a server or PC has a network connection between two or more networks or subnets. Generally, such a connection is created by the host server or PC having two or more network cards installed and each having an IP address and subnet mask from a different IP address range."
"A Default Gateway is simply the IP Address that a server or PC will send traffic to if it does not know of a more specific gateway to use."
"It is the IP Address that a server or computer will use to send network traffic when it has not got a more specific route to use, it is a 'last resort' - i.e., I have no idea where to send this traffic so i will send it to my default gateway."
